# Session 7 Labs:

## Checklist: 

Make sure you have your Python install working (ask for help if you don't). I would recommend doing these exercises in a jupyter notebook inside VScode
Clone this weeks git repo
Make sure you have numpy, pandas and beautiful soup installed 


## TASK 1:

Install and run though the basic operations of NUMPY. Once you have tried these, look at some of the operations we didn't cover. Try:

Split()
Sort()
Filter()

Check W3 schools for guidance on any of these: https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp 



## TASK 2:

Choose a .cvs file to work with. There are two in the repo. The demo file from W3 schools contains data around exercise stats. There is also a file containing the collection of a US art gallery.
See what data is in the file and think how you might want to view it
Clean the data, you can find how to do this here: https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_cleaning.asp
Find interesting correlations in the data. Eg. pulse to calorie burn, year to dimensions. Info on this process here: https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_correlations.asp


 Optional : Once you’ve done this,  find a new .cvs online and repeat the steps above. Museum exhibit list, sports stats (league tables ect… ) are fun. You can find a whole range to play with here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=csv



## TASK 3:

# Web-Scraping:

# Part 1:

Take a look at the example notebook. Make sure it will run correctly on your system. 
Run the code to scrape data from tables on a wiki page of your choice. 
Save as a .csv
Then, use pandas to clean the data (if needed) and try find some interesting correlations

# Part 2:

Work through the example image scraper notebook step by step.
Try to understand the process and then scrape the images from a different webpage to the example. NOTE: make sure you are allowed to scrape the page!
