## Session 06 labs

### Checklist before you start:
1. Create a folder on your disk for all your coding projects. You may want to avoid spaces in the folder path for easier navigation. Make sure you remember where it is.<br><br>
2. Download the Module 2: Introduction to Data Science repository to that folder and make sure it's connected to GitHub. You can do it using the "Clone" function in VSCode. Please do not edit or add any files to this folder.<br>

3. Create your own GitHub repository for this module on GitHub and set it up in your coding projects folder using the "Clone" function in VSCode.<br><br>
4. Make sure you installed Visual Studio Code, git, and Python 3.11. Make a virtual Python environment in the repository folder and add it to .gitignore.<br><br>
5. Create a text file on your desktop and paste the commands that you need to run the virtual environment.<br><br>

### Task 1
#### creating a JSON file - in the console
Using Python from the console, create and save a json file with your name, age, and a list of hobbies.

### Task 2
#### basic string operations - create a .py file you can run from the console
Create a Python script which lists of 10 most popular words in "The Story of the Fierce Bad Rabbit". You may want to remove punctuation before counting the words. Save the information in a readable format to a new .txt file and publish on your GitHub.

### Task 3
#### editing text - create a .py file you can run from the console
Try to edit the story by replacing some of the most popular words. Save it to a new file and publish on your GitHub. Share the story in your groups.

### Task 4
#### the MoMA dataset - work on it in a Jupyter notebook
Note: there are libraries that do parts fo these tasks for you, which we will learn next week. Today, please try to analyse this dataset using the built-in libraries and functions (for loops, csv library).

I suggest you do this exercise in a Jupyter notebook.

a. Find 5 artists with the most artworks in the dataset.

b. Find the artworks with the largest and smallest volumes (height x depth x length)

c. What is the most popular word in the title?

d. What materials only appear in the dataset once?

### Task 5
#### the Python challenge - in a Jupyter notebook
Complete at least the first 5 steps of the Python challenge. Save the solutions in a Jupyter notebook and publish it to your GitHub.

### Task 6 - homework
For the next class, find a dataset with a table in .csv, .json or .tsv format to explore. You can look on Kaggle, museum and library websites, statistics office websites, etc.
